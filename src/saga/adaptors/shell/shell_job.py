        The Shell job adaptor. This adaptor uses the sh command line tools (sh,
        ssh, gsissh) to run local and remote jobs.  The adaptor expects the
        login shell on the target host to be POSIX compliant.  However, one can
        also specify a custom POSIX shell via the resource manager URL, like::

          js = saga.job.Service ("ssh://remote.host.net/bin/sh")

        Note that custom shells in many cases will find a different environment
        than the users default login shell!


        Known Limitations:
        ******************

          * number of system pty's are limited:  each job.service object bound
            to this adaptor will use 2 pairs of pty pipes.  Systems usually
            limit the number of available pty's to 1024 .. 4096.  Given that
            other process also use pty's , that gives a hard limit to the number
            of object instances which can be created concurrently.  Hitting the
            pty limit will cause the following error message (or similar)::

              NoSuccess: pty_allocation or process creation failed (ENOENT: no more ptys)

            This limitation comes from saga.utils.pty_process.  On Linux
            systems, the utilization of pty's can be monitored::

               echo "allocated pty's: `cat /proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr`"
               echo "available pty's: `cat /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max`"


          * number of ssh connections are limited: sshd's default configuration,
            which is in place on many systems, limits the number of concurrent
            ssh connections to 10 per user -- beyond that, connections are
            refused with the following error::

              NoSuccess: ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host

            As the communication with the ssh channel is unbuffered, the
            dropping of the connection will likely cause this error message to
            be lost.  Instead, the adaptor will just see that the ssh connection
            disappeared, and will issue an error message similar to this one::

              NoSuccess: read from pty process failed (Could not read line - pty process died)

 
          * number of processes are limited: the creation of an job.service
            object will create one additional process on the local system, and
            two processes on the remote system (ssh daemon clone and a shell
            instance).  Each remote job will create three additional processes:
            two for the job instance itself (double fork), and an additional
            process which monitors the job for state changes etc.  Additional
            temporary processes may be needed as well.  

            While marked as 'obsolete' by POSIX, the `ulimit` command is
            available on many systems, and reports the number of processes
            available per user (`ulimit -u`)

            On hitting process limits, the job creation will fail with an error
            similar to either of these::
            
              NoSuccess: failed to run job (/bin/sh: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable)
              NoSuccess: failed to run job -- backend error

          * number of files are limited, as is disk space: the job.service will
            
            keep job state on the remote disk, in ``~/.saga/adaptors/shell_job/``.
            Quota limitations may limit the number of files created there,
            and/or the total size of that directory.  

            On quota or disk space limits, you may see error messages similar to
            the following ones::
            
              NoSuccess: read from pty process failed ([Errno 5] Quota exceeded)
              NoSuccess: read from pty process failed ([Errno 5] Input/output error)
              NoSuccess: find from pty process [Thread-5] failed (Could not read - pty process died)
              


          * Other system limits (memory, CPU, selinux, accounting etc.) apply as
            usual.

          
          * thread safety: it is safe to create multiple :class:`job.Service`
            instances to the same target host at a time -- they should not
            interfere with each other, but ``list()`` will list jobs created by
            either instance (if those use the same target host user account).

            It is **not** safe to use the *same* :class:`job.Service` instance
            from multiple threads concurrently -- the communication on the I/O
            channel will likely get screwed up.  This limitation may be removed
            in future versions of the adaptor.  Non-concurrent (i.e. serialized)
            use should work as expected though.
