# 4.1.3 File Transfer Specifications (GFD90 p 176-177)
#
# The syntax of a file transfer directive for the job description is modeled on
# the LSF syntax (LSF stands for Load Sharing Facility, a commercial job
# scheduler by Platform Computing), and has the general syntax:
# local_file operator remote_file
# Both the local_file and the remote_file can be URLs. If they are not URLs,
# but full or relative pathnames, then the local_file is relative to the host
# where the submission is executed, and the remote_file is evaluated on the
# execution host of the job. The operator is one of the following four:
#
# '>  copies the local file to the remote file before the job starts.
#      Overwrites the remote file if it exists.
# '>>' copies the local file to the remote file before the job starts.
#      Appends to the remote file if it exists.
# '<'  copies the remote file to the local file after the job finishes.
#      Overwrites the local file if it exists.
# '<<' copies the remote file to the local file after the job finishes.
#      Appends to the local file if it exists.
