Logging System
##############

In a distributed environment unified error logging and reporting is a crucial
capability for debugging and monitoring. SAGA has a configurable logging system
that  captures debug, info, warning and error messages across all of
its middelware adaptors. The logging system can be controlled in two different
ways: via :ref:`env_vars` variables, which should be sufficient in most 
scenarios, and via the :ref:`log_api`, which provides programmatic access to
the logging system for advanced use-cases.


.. _env_vars:

Environment Variables
---------------------

Several environment variables can be used to control SAGA's logging behavior from 
the command line. Obviously, this can come in handy when debugging a problem
with an existing SAGA application. Environment variables are set in the 
executing shell and evaluated by SAGA at program startup. 

.. envvar:: SAGA_VERBOSE

   Controls the log level. This controls the amount of output generated by the
   logging system. ``SAGA_VERBOSE`` expects either a numeric (0-4) value or a 
   string (case insensitive) representing the log level:

   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | Numeric Value | Log Level           | Type of Messages Displayed         |
   +===============+=====================+====================================+
   | 0             | ``CRITICAL``        | Only fatal events that will cause  |
   | (default)     |                     | SAGA to abort.                     | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 1             | ``ERROR``           | Errors that will not necessarily   |
   |               |                     | cause SAGA to abort.               | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 2             | ``WARNING``         | Warnings that are generated by     |
   |               |                     | SAGA and its middleware adaptors.  | 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 3             | ``INFO``            | Useful (?) runtime information     |   
   |               |                     | that is generated by SAGA and its  | 
   |               |                     | middleware adaptors.               |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
   | 4             | ``DEBUG``           | Debug message added to the code    |
   |               |                     | by the developers. (Lots of output)| 
   |               |                     |                                    |
   +---------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+

   For example, if you want to see the debug messages that SAGA generates during 
   program execution, you would set :envvar:`SAGA_VERBOSE` to ``DEBUG`` before 
   you run your program::

       SAGA_VERBOSE=DEBUG python mysagaprog.py


.. envvar:: SAGA_LOG_FILTERS

   Controls the message sources displayed. SAGA uses a 
   hierarchal structure for its log sources. Starting with the root logger
   ``saga``, several sub loggers are defined for SAGA-internal logging events
   (``saga.core``) and individual middleware adaptors ``saga.adaptor.name``.
   ``SAGA_LOG_FILTERS`` expects either a single source name or a 
   comma-separated list of source names. Non-existing source names are ignored.

   For example, if you want to see only the debug messages generated by 
   ``saga.core`` and a specific middleware adaptor called ``xyz`` you would 
   set the following environment variables::

       SAGA_VERBOSE=DEBUG SAGA_LOG_FILTERS=saga.core,saga.adaptor.xyz python mysagaprog.py

.. envvar:: SAGA_LOG_TARGETS

   Controls where the log messages go. Multiple concurrent locations are 
   supported. 
   ``SAGA_LOG_TARGETS`` expects either a single location or a comma-separated 
   list of locations, where a location can either be a path/filename or
   the ``STDOUT`` keyword (case insensitive) for logging to the console. 

   For example, if you want to see debug messages on the console but also
   want to log them in a file for further analysis, you would set the the 
   following environment variables::

       SAGA_VERBOSE=DEBUG SAGA_LOG_TARGETS=STDOUT,/tmp/mysaga.log python mysagaprog.py

.. _log_api:

Logging API
-----------

The SAGA logging system can be controlled directly  
from within an application using SAGA's logging API. This can come in handy if 
you want to integrate SAGA log messages with an existing Python logging system, 
re-format the output or something slightly more involved:: 



Module saga.core.logging
************************

The logging module provides classes and functions to change the behavior of
SAGA's logging system. The :func:`getConfig` function is used to get a
:class:`Config` object which can be used to introspect and change configuration
system options::

   from saga.core.logging import getConfig as getLoggingConfig

   log_conf = getLoggingConfig()
   log_conf.level = "DEBUG" # or 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'

   # change output channels 
   if "STDOUT" in log_conf.targets:
       log_conf.targets.remove('STDOUT')
       log_conf.targets.add('/tmp/myapp.log')

   # reset all filters
   log_conf.filters = set()

   # show all active loggers
   print log_conf.get_registered_logger_names()
