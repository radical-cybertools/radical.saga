        This methods reads bytes from the child process until a string matching
        any of the given patterns is found.  If that is found, all read data are
        returned as a string, up to (and including) the match.  Note that
        pattern can match an empty string, and the call then will return just
        that, an empty string.  If all patterns end with matching a newline,
        this method is effectively matching lines -- but note that '$' will also
        match the end of the (currently available) data stream.

        The call actually returns a tuple, containing the index of the matching
        pattern, and the string up to the match as described above.

        If no pattern is found before timeout, the call returns (None, None).
        Negative timeouts will block until a match is found

        Note that the pattern are interpreted with the re.M (multi-line) and
        re.S (dot matches all) regex flags.

        Performance: the call is doing repeated string regex searches over
        whatever data it finds.  On complex regexes, and large data, and small
        read buffers, this method can be expensive.  

        Note: the returned data get '\\\\r' stripped.

        kept in the returned data.
